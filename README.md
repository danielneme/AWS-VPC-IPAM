# AWS-VPC-IPAM
Deploying AWS VCP IPAM with Terraform.

Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is a VPC feature that makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads. 
You can use IPAM automated workflows to more efficiently manage IP addresses.

You can use IPAM to do the following:

    Organize IP address space into routing and security domains

    Monitor IP address space that's in use and monitor resources that are using space against business rules

    View the history of IP address assignments in your organization

    Automatically allocate CIDRs to VPCs using specific business rules

    Troubleshoot network connectivity issues

    Enable cross-region and cross-account sharing of your Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) addresses

    Provision Amazon-provided contiguous IPv6 CIDR blocks to pools for VPC creation
